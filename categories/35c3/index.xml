      <description>This blog post will summarize my experience attending 35th Chaos Communication Congress AKA 35c3, which took place between 27th and 30th December 2018 in Leipzig, Germany. The Congress hosts a variety of talks, assemblies and serves as a meeting point for thousands of people from the security and hackerspace communities. Moreover, the Congress covers many other different topics ranging from arts &amp;amp; culture, technology, hobby projects as well as politics. In this post, I will be mainly focusing on the security and technical talks of the conference.</description>
