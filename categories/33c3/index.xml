      <description>I visited 33rd Chaos Communication Congress, which took place between 27th and 30th December 2016 in CCH in Hamburg. The motto of last year&amp;rsquo;s congress was Works for me. This was my fifth attendance of the Chaos Communication Congress.
The overall atmosphere on the Congress and organization was excellent as always. However, I have to admit that the quallity of talks was worse when compared to previous years. During previous Congresses I had problems with choosing which talk to attend as there were too many of them I wanted to visit at the same time.</description>
