      <description>My name is Adam and I enjoy playing with technology. I studied computer networks at the Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies at Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava.
When I was 14, I started playing with UNIX-like operating systems and never stopped since then. In my free time, I try to contribute to various open source projects or experiment with technology. Whenever I have to code, I do all my projects in Python.</description>
