Welcome to my personal blog! I had an idea of creating personal blog for a very long time. However, I was always lazy to do so.

When I was looking for some blogging engine, I realized that none of the major ones suited me. So I started to experiment with various setups and then I discovered [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), which is static blog generator. I like the idea of having a blog completely stored in version control of my choice and served as static pages.
Later I found [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), which can be described as ``jekyll on steroids''. It is much easier to deploy, it integrates many 3rd party plugins for Twitter, Disquis comments, Google Analytics and other services. It uses HTML 5 template and interface is optimized for viewing on mobile phones. It has everything modern blogging platform should have.

So again welcome to my blog and happy reading.
