title: Migration from Octopress to Hugo
---

After a while, my blog finally received love it deserved. The biggest change is
that I migrated the blog from Octopress to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), which is a
fast static site generator written in Go. The overall feeling stayed the same,
but the blog maintenance is much easier for me. I am still finding my way around Hugo,
but so far it works nicely. Another change is that this site is being hosted on
Github Pages. So, as the website was refreshed, we might concentrate more
on blogging. Happy reading!
