I arrived at CCH in the afternoon and headed directly for **NOC Review** talk. Guys did really wonderful job, although the Wifi was a problem. I really liked some network facts:

* ~70 access points, great signal coverage
* 3059 concurrent wireless clients connected during peaks
* traffic usage of 8.2 Gbps
* 40% of traffic being IPv6

Video can be found [here](http://ftp.uni-kl.de/CCC/29C3/mp4-h264-HQ/29c3-5404-en-noc_review_h264.mp4).

The 29C3 was really nice experience and I will definitely return back to 30C3. Another nice thing was that event of this size was run entirely by the volunteers. I would like to take part in helping as a Chaos Angel or directly as a speaker next year. We will see what will 2013 bring.
