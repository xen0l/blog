My name is Adam and I enjoy playing with technology. I studied computer networks at the Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies at Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava.

When I was 14, I started playing with UNIX-like operating systems and never stopped since then. In my free time, I try to contribute to various open source projects or experiment with technology. Whenever I have to code, I do all my projects in Python. When I am not playing with technology or coding, I can be found listening to music, hanging out on IRC, drinking a beer or studying history.

I am interested in the following areas:

* operating system internals,
* computer networks & protocols,
* security, especially cryprography,
* scalability & distributed systems.

If you enjoy chatting about the technology, feel free to contact me.p I am also actively looking for new challenges!
